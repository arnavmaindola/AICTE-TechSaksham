Human Pose Estimation
Real-Time Human Pose Estimation
This project is a real-time human pose estimation system leveraging machine learning techniques to detect and map human body landmarks. With applications spanning medicine, sports analysis, virtual reality, and robotics, this system demonstrates the potential of computer vision to solve complex problems efficiently.

Project Overview
The system utilizes pre-trained models from MediaPipe's Pose Library, known for its speed and accuracy, to identify and track 33 body landmarks. It processes input from live video feeds or recorded images, detects key points, and maps them to represent the human skeleton in real time.

Key Features
Real-Time Processing: Detects and maps body landmarks instantly for live video feeds.
High Accuracy: Achieves ~95% accuracy for full-body pose estimation and ~97% for facial landmark detection.
Robust Performance: Performs well under various conditions, including different lighting, occlusions, and diverse poses.
Modular Design: Scalable system architecture with separate modules for preprocessing, pose estimation, and post-processing.
System Design
Input Source: Accepts live webcam feeds or recorded videos/images.
Preprocessing: Standardizes resolution, brightness, and contrast for optimized input.
Pose Estimation Engine: Utilizes MediaPipe's Pose library to detect 33 body landmarks.
Post-Processing: Refines output, smoothens motion data, and overlays skeletal visuals.
Output Module: Displays visualized skeleton and provides feedback for posture or movement.
Applications
Sports Training: Offers athletes real-time feedback on posture and movement to improve performance and reduce injury risks.
Healthcare: Tracks physical therapy exercises and assists in posture correction.
Virtual Reality: Enhances interaction in VR environments with precise body tracking.
Human-Computer Interaction: Powers gesture-based control systems for various applications.
